# Custom Proton Prefix Scripting

## Setup

1. Install Steam
2. Install any small game and force it to use proton of your liking so that steam installs proton version
3. make install
4. Now run '~/bin/pfx_run ~/Download/TeamSpeak.exe' to install the program in the prefix
5. '~/bin/Teamspeak.sh' to run TeamSpeak from the prefix

Easy as pie.
